## Introduction

This dashboard was created to show my Excel skills. I'm currently learning to become a Data Analyst, and wanted test my new skills. Also, F1 is one of my favourite sport. 75 years of F1 history, with a tons of data.

In this spreadsheet, I wanted to see, and show all F1 nations statistics.
You can download here: [f1_nation.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21162541/f1_nation.xlsx)

### Excel skills, and tools I used
1. ðŸ“‘ Pivot Tables
2. ðŸ“Š Charts
3. âœ… Data Validation
4. ðŸ§® Formulas and Functions

### Main indicators
In Formula 1, these indicators are the most common, and used in statistics.
- Points
- Entries
- Starts
- Podiums
- Wins
- Pole Positions
- Fastest laps
- Nation most success driver

## How do I build up?

ðŸ§¹ **Data cleaning**
Imported the data from Wikipedia

I needed to clean the data, especially in points column. There were a several points system in F1, and a lot of drivers got subpoints (X.5, X.3 etc...). I cleaned it, however I left the halfpoints in, because in the recent points system drivers can get halfpoints.




ðŸš© **Make nation datasheet**

Deleted duplicated nation, then sorted in alphabetic order.




ðŸ§® **Make indicators datasheets**

I sorted the nations, and the related points to them. I used *SUMIFS* to summarise all points, wins, poles etc...
After that, I used *XLOOKUP* to search, to look up the data I need. Naturally I always sorted in alphabetic order.




âœ… **Data Validations**

On the dashboard sheet, I made a data validation (list) to chose which nation show on the dashboard, with data, and on the charts.




ðŸ“Š **Chart**

The final steps. Inserted a clustered bar chart. I put not only the selected nation, but also the all nation median, and average data.




ðŸ“Ÿ **KPI**

Next to the chart, we see the selected nation (in this sample, Poland) statistics. This KPIs are all linked to their sheets.


## Conclusion

This dashboard was good for me to test, and prove my skill. Also, I can show which is the most success, and of course *oldest* nation in the Formula 1 history. Finally, it was a good pratice, project to show my skill, and check where I am right now in Excel knowledge.
